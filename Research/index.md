My research is rooted in how animals adapt to their environment and how these adaptations drive biodiversity.
I integrate genomics and bioinformatics with ecological, physiological, morphological, and spatial data in a
comparative phylogenetic framework, using a historical perspective to make robust inferences about adaptive
processes across taxa. I work at different levels of biological organization, from individuals to populations
to species, to link broad macroevolutionary patterns to microevolutionary processes. Using cutting edge
computational resources, I connect genomic variation to environmental adaptation, trait complexity, and
species diversity across spatially complex continental scales. My research centers on the following major themes. 

## Genomic drivers of ecological opportunity

How does the genome facilitate lineages to exploit ecological opportunity, allowing them to diversify and
persist in niche space?

## Phylogenomics and lineage diversification

What does the genome tell us about the relationships between different lineages and how does it clarify
patterns of lineage diversification across multiple taxonomic scales?

## Phylogenetic genotype-to-phenotype mapping across lineages

What are the underlying genomic mechanisms of the complex traits that arise out of ecological opportunity
and are the same mechanisms follow parallel pathways which result in convergent phenotypes?
